# HTML-CSS-Uppgift1-ToDoList

To make a ToDo List as similar as possible.

Works both with:
* Enter-key
* OK-button

 Notice abt **empty input** blinks each time when the input is entered empty after something has been added before it, but it doesn't blink when empty input has been done sequentially several times in a row.
